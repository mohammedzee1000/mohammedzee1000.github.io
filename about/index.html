<h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>

<hr />

<p><br></p>

<p>Hi, I am Mohammed Zeeshan Ahmed and  I am a technologist, engineer, linux lover and free and open source software enthusiast.</p>

<p>I fell in love with linux at a very young age (when I was in 4th standard actually when I wrote my first Hello world program in C on a Unix based computer. I transitioned Unix –&gt; Linux soon after though exactly how soon, my memory fails me), though I got introduced to technology much earlier though 8-bit gaming consoles and my first Pentium 3 based computer running Windows 95.</p>

<p>I have been an avid linux user ever since, with my favorite distributions being Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Blackbox.</p>

<p>Of course, as a gamer I do have good hand with the Windows Operating System as well .</p>

<p>I love programming, and yes proudly say that I am a hacker, in the true sense of the word.</p>
