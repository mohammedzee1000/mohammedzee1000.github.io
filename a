Hi, I am Mohammed Zeeshan Ahmed and  I am a technologist, engineer, linux lover and free and open source software enthusiast.

I fell in love with linux at a very young age (when I was in 4th standard actually when I wrote my first Hello world program in C on a Unix based computer. I transitioned Unix â€“> Linux soon after though exactly how soon, my memory fails me), though I got introduced to technology much earlier though 8-bit gaming consoles and my first Pentium 3 based computer running Windows 95.

I have been an avid linux user ever since, with my favorite distributions being Fedora, Arch, openSUSE, CentOS, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Blackbox.

When I am not riding my keyboard, I enjoy travelling, am an avid reader and love to establish genuine lasting relationships with people :). I am also a computer gamer.

Of course, as a gamer I do have good hand with the Windows Operating System as well.

I love programming, and yes proudly say that I am a hacker, in the true sense of the word.
