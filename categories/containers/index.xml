      <description>I still cannot believe it. It was slightly more than 6 months ago, that i started contributing to Kubernetes.
I had joined Red Hat, approximately 2 and half years ago, working on container technologies, mostly with tools to help developers get an easy path into the world of containers, and of Kubernetes.
While i got a lot of experience with Kubernetes, via OpenShift, i never really got an opportunity to contribute to the project itself, except for a stray issue or two.</description>
