      <description>I still cant believe that I just recently completed my 6th year at Red Hat as a Software Engineer.
It was on 18th January 2016, 6 years ago, that I joined Red Hat as a software engineer, after a short 5 month stint as a system adminstrator. During this period, I learnt a lot of stuff from people all around me, both from the Kubernetes Community, as well as people at Red hat.</description>

      <description>The Six Month Checkpoint:
I still cannot believe it. It was slightly more than 6 months ago, that i started contributing to Kubernetes.
I had joined Red Hat, approximately 2 and half years ago, working on container technologies, mostly with tools to help developers get an easy path into the world of containers, and of Kubernetes.
While i got a lot of experience with Kubernetes, via OpenShift, i never really got an opportunity to contribute to the project itself, except for a stray issue or two.</description>
