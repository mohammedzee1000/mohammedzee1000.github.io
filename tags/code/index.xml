as a Software Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on 18th January 2016, 6 years ago, that I joined Red Hat as a software engineer, after a short 5 month stint as a system adminstrator. During this period, I learnt a lot of stuff from people all around me, both from the Kubernetes Community, as well as people at Red hat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kontributing to Kubernetes</title><link>https://mzee1000.dev/posts/10-02-2018_kubernetes_community/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 20:21:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mzee1000.dev/posts/10-02-2018_kubernetes_community/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Six Month Checkpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still cannot believe it. It was slightly more than 6 months ago, that i started contributing to &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had joined &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 2 and half years ago, working on container technologies, mostly with tools to help developers get an easy path into the world of containers, and of
Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While i got a lot of experience with Kubernetes, via &lt;a href="https://www.okd.io/"&gt;OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;, i never really got an opportunity to contribute to the project itself, except for a stray issue or two. I did get to interact with some amazing people who contributed to the project, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheNikhita"&gt;Nikita&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzychef"&gt;Josh Berkus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
