&lt;p>I still cannot believe it. It was slightly more than 6 months ago, that i started contributing to &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had joined &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat&lt;/a>, approximately 2 and half years ago, working on container technologies, mostly with tools to help developers get an easy path into the world of containers, and of
Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While i got a lot of experience with Kubernetes, via &lt;a href="https://www.okd.io/">OpenShift&lt;/a>, i never really got an opportunity to contribute to the project itself, except for a stray issue or two. I did get to interact with some amazing people who contributed to the project, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheNikhita">Nikita&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzychef">Josh Berkus&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
